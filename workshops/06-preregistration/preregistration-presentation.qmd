# What is Preregistration?

## Definition

> Preregistration refers to posting a **timestamped outline**  
> of the research questions, hypotheses, method, and analysis plan  
> for a specific project **prior to data collection and/or analysis**


**Key principle:** Distinguish between:

- **Confirmatory research** (pre-planned)  
- **Exploratory research** (data-driven discovery)


## The Preregistration Spectrum

**Three Levels of Preregistration:**

1. **Simple:** Basic hypotheses & methods (Easy)
2. **Detailed:** Comprehensive analysis plans (Medium)  
3. **Registered Reports:** Peer review before data collection (Difficult)

Preregistrations can vary from simple outlines to comprehensive analysis plans with pre-written code


# Why Preregister?

## Problem 1: Publication Bias

- **Null results rarely published**
- **Replication rate:** Only 1 in 400 studies
- **80% of tested hypotheses** reported as "confirmed" across 4,600 papers
- **Cross-linguistic variation** underreported

**Result:** Scientific record biased toward positive findings

## Problem 2: Researcher Degrees of Freedom

- **Post-hoc acoustic measure selection**
- **Flexible participant exclusion criteria**
- **Multiple eye-tracking measures** available
- **Model specification** after seeing data

**Consequence:** False positives may mislead theory development

## Why This Matters for Experimental Linguistics

**Recent findings from our field:**

- **Low replication rates:** Similar to psychology's "replication crisis"
- **McGurk effect replication failures:** Classic findings not always robust
- **Eye-tracking studies:** Different measures can yield different conclusions
- **Cross-linguistic assumptions:** English-based theories don't always generalize

**Evidence:** Roettger (2021) documents widespread analytical flexibility in linguistics

## Common Concern 1: "My data collection is unpredictable"


- âœ… **Preregister decision trees** for contingencies
- âœ… **Document changes** transparently
- âœ… **Example:** Children falling asleep during experiment


## Common Concern 2: "I need exploratory analyses"


- âœ… **Preregistration only constrains** confirmatory part
- âœ… **Explore freely** after confirmatory tests
- âœ… **Just label findings** appropriately


## Common Concern 3: "I'm working with existing corpora"


- âœ… **Can preregister analysis** of existing data
- âœ… **Example:** HCRC Map Task Corpus analysis
- âœ… **Reduces post-hoc** analytical flexibility


## Common Concern 4: "Statistical models often fail to converge"


- âœ… **Preregister model simplification** procedures
- âœ… **Define convergence failure** handling
- âœ… **Plan for data transformation** needs


## Common Concern 5: "I don't have concrete predictions yet"


- âœ… **Perfectly fine** for early-stage research
- âœ… **Explore first,** then confirm on new data
- âœ… **Frame exploratory studies** appropriately


## Common Concern 6: "My field is observational, not experimental"


- âœ… **Preregistration mainly** for confirmatory research
- âœ… **Much linguistics is exploratory** by nature
- âœ… **Value different types** of inquiry equally



**Key insight:** Preregistration is flexible and adaptable to linguistic research


# How to Preregister

## What to Include: Key Questions (Roettger, 2021)


1. **Data collection:** Who, how many, where, when?
2. **Inclusion/exclusion:** Specific operational criteria
3. **Materials:** Stimulus selection and norming procedures  
4. **Procedure:** Exact experimental protocol
5. **Variables:** How will constructs be measured?
6. **Statistical models:** Model formula, random effects structure
7. **Inference:** What constitutes support for your hypothesis?
8. **Contingencies:** What if models don't converge? Missing data?



**Goal:** Be specific enough that a skeptical reader is convinced you planned ahead

# Practical Implementation

## Getting Started: Step by Step


1. **Choose your platform** (start with AsPredicted for simplicity)
2. **Select appropriate template**
3. **Draft your preregistration** (can save as draft)
4. **Discuss with advisors/collaborators**
5. **Finalize and register** (becomes timestamped)
6. **Conduct your study** as planned
7. **Report** confirmatory vs exploratory findings


## Working with Advisors


- **Communicate early** about preregistration goals
- **Share resources** if they're unfamiliar with the process
- **Frame as written study design** (familiar concept)
- **Emphasize benefits** for the research quality
- **Start simple** if they're hesitant


## Timeline Considerations

**Typical Preregistration Timeline:**

- **Planning Phase (4 weeks):**
  - Draft preregistration (2 weeks)
  - Advisor review (1 week)  
  - Revisions (1 week)

- **Execution Phase (12+ weeks):**
  - Register study (1 day)
  - Data collection (8 weeks)
  - Analysis (4 weeks)

## Managing Deviations

**When things don't go as planned:**


- **Document changes** transparently
- **Explain reasons** for deviations
- **Create new registration** if major changes needed
- **Distinguish** planned vs unplanned analyses in results



**Remember:** Transparency is the goal, not perfect adherence


## What If Things Don't Go 'As Predicted'?

**Standard language for reporting deviations:**


- *"Contrary to expectations, we found that..."*
- *"Unexpectedly, we also found that..."*
- *"In addition to the analyses we pre-registered we also ran..."*
- *"We encountered an unexpected situation,  
  and followed our Standard Operating Procedure"*



**Key principle:** Transparency, not perfection


## Interactive Exercise: Issues That Arise

**Scenario:** You preregistered a study but encountered problems:


- **Lower response rate** than expected
- **Technical problem** with one measure  
- **Discovered relevant covariate** during analysis
- **Found unexpected pattern** in data



**Discussion:** How would you handle each?



# Examples and Practice

## Example: Simple AsPredicted Registration

**The 9 AsPredicted Questions:**

1. **Data collection:** Have you already collected the data?
2. **Hypothesis:** What's the main question/hypothesis?
3. **Dependent variable:** What are you measuring?
4. **Conditions:** How many conditions?
5. **Analyses:** What statistical analysis?
6. **Outliers:** How will you handle outliers?
7. **Sample size:** How many observations?
8. **Other:** Anything else you would like to pre-register?
9. **Name:** Give a title to this AsPredicted pre-registration


**Result:** Time-stamped PDF with unique URL for verification


## Example: Psycholinguistic Experiment

**Research Question:** How does prosodic prominence  
affect syntactic processing in German?

**Hypothesis:** Prominent words will show faster integration into syntactic structure

**Participants:** 40 German native speakers, 18-35 years, no language disorders

**Materials:** 120 sentences with prominence manipulation, normed for frequency/length

**Procedure:** Self-paced reading + comprehension questions

**Analysis:** Linear mixed-effects models with prominence as fixed factor

**Exclusions:** Accuracy <80% on comprehension, reading times >3 SDs

## Example: Corpus Study with Existing Data

**Research Question:** Does word predictability  
affect pronunciation in spontaneous speech?

**Data:** HCRC Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al., 1991)

**Preregistered decisions:**
- **Predictability measure:** Trigram probability from Google Books
- **Acoustic measure:** Mean F0 of vowel nucleus
- **Control variables:** Speaker sex, utterance position, word frequency
- **Exclusions:** Function words, words <3 phonemes
- **Model:** Linear mixed-effects: F0 ~ predictability + controls + (1|speaker)

**Key insight:** Even with existing data, many analytical choices remain

# Key Takeaways

## The Bottom Line for Linguists


- **Preregistration enhances** credibility of psycholinguistic research
- **Start simple** with basic hypotheses and methods
- **Language research is compatible** with preregistration principles
- **Exploratory linguistics** remains valuable (just label it clearly)
- **Not all linguistic subfields** need preregistration  
  (observational research is different)
- **SFB 1252 can lead** the field in transparent language science
- **Individual benefits:** Better study design,  
  protection from criticism, career advantages
- **Your theoretical contributions** become more impactful



**Roettger's key insight:** "Preregistration is not a panacea for all problems,  
but it's a practice we can integrate into our work flow right away"


## Next Steps for SFB 1252


1. **Explore platforms** (OSF recommended for complex linguistic studies)
2. **Try preregistering** your next experiment or corpus study
3. **Discuss with your project team** about adoption
4. **Consider joint preregistrations** for collaborative studies
5. **Share experiences** in future RDM workshops
