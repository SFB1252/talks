# AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

This document establishes best practices and guidelines for using AI tools in academic web development projects, based on the experience of developing this Research Data and Methods Workshop Series website.

## Overview

AI-assisted development can significantly enhance productivity and quality in academic web projects when implemented with proper oversight, transparency, and ethical considerations. These guidelines ensure responsible use of AI tools while maintaining academic integrity and quality standards.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency and Attribution

**Full Disclosure**
- Clearly document all AI tools used in the development process
- Specify AI models, versions, and service providers
- Distinguish between AI-generated and human-created content
- Maintain detailed records of AI assistance throughout the project

**Proper Attribution**
- Credit AI tools in project documentation
- Include AI assistance in acknowledgments where appropriate
- Follow institutional guidelines for AI attribution
- Respect intellectual property and licensing requirements

### 2. Human Oversight and Quality Assurance

**Continuous Review**
- Every AI-generated output must be reviewed by qualified humans
- Implement systematic quality control processes
- Validate technical accuracy and academic standards
- Ensure compliance with accessibility and usability requirements

**Expert Validation**
- Subject matter experts should review content accuracy
- Technical experts should validate code quality and security
- Academic standards should be verified by qualified reviewers
- User experience should be tested with real users

### 3. Academic Integrity

**Ethical Use**
- Comply with institutional AI policies and guidelines
- Respect copyright and intellectual property rights
- Maintain academic honesty in all AI-assisted work
- Follow disciplinary standards for AI use in research

**Quality Standards**
- Maintain the same quality standards as non-AI-assisted work
- Ensure AI assistance enhances rather than replaces human expertise
- Validate all claims and information provided by AI tools
- Apply critical thinking to all AI-generated suggestions

## Implementation Guidelines

- Create templates for documentation and attribution

### During Development

**Prompt Engineering Best Practices**
- Use clear, specific, and detailed prompts
- Provide sufficient context for AI understanding
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable components
- Iterate and refine prompts based on output quality

**Quality Control Workflow**
1. **AI Generation**: Use AI tools to create initial content or code
2. **Initial Review**: Quick assessment of output relevance and quality
3. **Technical Validation**: Detailed review of technical accuracy
4. **Content Review**: Verification of factual accuracy and appropriateness
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure compatibility with existing systems
6. **Final Approval**: Sign-off by qualified human reviewer

**Documentation Requirements**
- Record all AI tools and versions used
- Document prompts and AI responses for significant contributions
- Track iterations and refinements
- Maintain version control with clear commit messages

### Post-Development Review

**Comprehensive Assessment**
- Evaluate overall quality and effectiveness of AI assistance
- Identify areas where AI was most and least helpful
- Document lessons learned and best practices
- Assess compliance with guidelines and standards

**Ongoing Maintenance**
- Establish procedures for updating AI-assisted content
- Plan for regular review and validation cycles
- Monitor for changes in AI tool capabilities or policies
- Update documentation and attribution as needed

## Specific Use Cases

**Quality Assurance**
- Verify factual accuracy of all AI-generated content
- Ensure consistency with institutional voice and style
- Check for appropriate academic tone and language
- Validate citations and references

### Code Development

**Appropriate Uses**
- Generating boilerplate code and templates
- Creating CSS styles and responsive layouts
- Implementing standard functionality and features
- Debugging and optimization suggestions

**Quality Assurance**
- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Test functionality across different browsers and devices
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Ensure code maintainability and documentation

### Design and User Experience

**Appropriate Uses**
- Creating responsive layout structures
- Generating color schemes and typography suggestions
- Implementing accessibility features
- Optimizing user interface elements

**Quality Assurance**
- Test with real users and gather feedback
- Validate accessibility with automated and manual testing
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Review against design principles and best practices

## Risk Management

### Common Pitfalls
