# Website Development Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of how this Research Data and Methods Workshop Series website was developed using AI-assisted tools and modern web development practices.

## Development Overview

This Jekyll-based website was created through a collaborative process between human researchers and AI assistance, specifically using Claude Sonnet 4 via OpenRouter with the Cline development environment. This approach demonstrates how AI tools can be effectively integrated into academic web development while maintaining quality standards and transparency.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Static Site Generator**: Jekyll
- **Markup Language**: Markdown with Liquid templating
- **Styling**: CSS with responsive design principles
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

### AI-Assisted Development Tools
- **AI Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic)
- **API Service**: OpenRouter
- **Development Environment**: Cline (VS Code extension)
- **Human Oversight**: Continuous review and quality assurance

## Development Workflow

### 1. Initial Planning and Architecture

The development process began with human-defined requirements:
- Academic workshop series presentation
- Clear navigation and organization
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Easy content management for workshop organizers
- Integration with existing academic workflows

### 2. AI-Assisted Implementation

**Content Generation:**
- AI assistance in structuring workshop descriptions
- Template creation for consistent formatting
- Navigation menu organization
- Responsive layout implementation

**Code Development:**
- Jekyll configuration and setup
- HTML template creation with Liquid syntax
- CSS styling for academic presentation
- Markdown content structuring

**Quality Assurance:**
- Human review of all AI-generated content
- Testing across different devices and browsers
- Validation of academic standards and accessibility
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

### 3. Human Oversight and Review

Every AI-generated component underwent human review:
- **Content Accuracy**: Verification of workshop information
- **Technical Quality**: Code review and testing
- **Academic Standards**: Compliance with institutional guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring inclusive design principles
